# Transfusion Validation Intelligence Platform (TVIP)

A clinical validation simulation platform designed to demonstrate automated validation workflows for Blood Bank / BECS systems used during hospital LIS and EHR implementations.

---

## Overview

The Transfusion Validation Intelligence Platform (TVIP) simulates validation workflows commonly used when implementing Blood Bank systems such as:

- Epic Beaker
- Cerner Millennium
- Sunquest
- SoftBank
- Ortho Vision / Immucor systems

The platform validates RBC compatibility scenarios, evaluates risk, and produces validation evidence reports.

---

## Key Features

### Blood Compatibility Engine
Simulates ABO/Rh compatibility validation logic.

### Antibody & Crossmatch Gate
Applies clinical validation rules for antibody screening and crossmatch incompatibility.

### Risk Assessment Matrix
Evaluates validation risk levels:

- LOW
- MODERATE
- HIGH
- CRITICAL

### Evidence Hashing
Each validation run produces a cryptographic evidence hash to verify data integrity.

### Validation Documentation
Generates validation evidence reports in PDF format.

### FHIR Export
Exports validation results as simplified FHIR resources.

### Validation Scenario Packs
Allows batch execution of validation scenarios.

### Clinical Validation Dashboard
Displays:

- total validation runs
- pass/fail counts
- risk distribution
- validation run history

### Master Validation Report
Generates a consolidated validation report for regulatory documentation.

## Example Workflow

1. Run validation scenarios
2. Compatibility engine evaluates donor/recipient pairs
3. Risk scoring engine assigns risk level
4. Validation run recorded with evidence hash
5. Validation report generated
6. Results displayed in dashboard analytics

---

## Example Dashboard

Validation dashboard provides visibility into:

- validation run history
- risk distribution
- pass/fail metrics

---

## Technology Stack

Backend:
- Python
- FastAPI

Validation Engine:
- Custom compatibility rules
- Risk scoring matrix

Reporting:
- ReportLab (PDF generation)

Frontend:
- HTML
- Chart.js dashboard
